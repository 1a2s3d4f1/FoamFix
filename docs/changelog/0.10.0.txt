Changes:

* Optimized model deduplication speed, though with the increased number of recursion it won't be noticeable
  in practice - however, it should lead to more RAM saved.
* The new recommended deduplicateModelsMaxRecursion value is 9. If you run into any issues, please let me know
  if the issues persist after setting the value back to 6!

Bugs fixed:

* [GitHub/#162, GitHub/#127] Improve deduplication blacklist
* [GitHub/#153] Not detecting AMD/ATI cards on Linux with open drivers
* [GitHub/#115] Workaround for long-standing, undebuggable BiblioCraft issue
* Property caching not being implemented correctly
