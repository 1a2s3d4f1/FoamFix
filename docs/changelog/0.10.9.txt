* Added the "client.deduplicateModels" option, to disable specifically deduplication of baked models.
* Fixed disabling the "client.deduplicateModelBakers" option causing the progress bar to not be properly removed.
* Fixed NotEnoughIDs not auto-disabling the "coremod.smallPropertyStorage" option, which it seems to have issues with.
* Removed unused debug message in ProxyCommon.preInit.
